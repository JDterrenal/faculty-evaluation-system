The Project Proposal Application for Funding Form has five sections:

  1. Background and justification of the project
  2. Objectives of the project
  3. Expected results of the project
  4. Project implementation and management
  5. Project budget
  6. System Integration Framework


**I. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION**

This section should provide a brief introduction to the current social and economic situation related to the geographic region and beneficiaries of the project. The background should also describe:

1. Schools will need an evaluation feature to rate and monitor the performance of the teachers and how well the students like them. The problem is, schools will want to see how well a teacher performs on their jobs and how the student likes how they teach. With a Faculty Evaluation System, these will no longer be a problem since the school management will be able to see the ratings of each teacher and how the students liked their performance. With this, the management can determine and see who the best teachers are in the school currently. This will also open up opportunities for teachers to improve their teaching if they get low ratings, this way, we can see teachers who are underperforming, and teachers that are doing really well.
2. Following are the list that relates the proposal to other relevant national development strategies and policies:
  - Quality of life
  - Development planning and drafting
  - Set objectives
  - Identified weakness and strengths
3. Programs and activities that will complement the proposal includes:
  - Google Docs - The main collaboration tool that the team uses which leads toward the completion of the project.
  - MS Word - The tool used to finalise the formatting of the project proposal.
  - Visual Studio Code - The main programming application to be used towards the development of the main project after the proposal.
  - diagrams.net - The tool used to create all the charts and diagrams for the Framework of System Integration and Architecture..
4. Schools will need a way to monitor the performance of their teachers, that's how the need for the project development was determined. With a Faculty Evaluation System, each student can rate the performance of their teachers. With that, it is possible to see the profile of each teacher and their ratings. With a system like this, the management will have a way to see the highest rated teachers all throughout the school.
5. No intended beneficiaries were involved in the project planning. They are however used as a reference on how the overall project is going to work, how the project is going to be and what features will be implemented.

**II. OBJECTIVES**

**A. Development objectives**

The sole purpose of this project is to improve the quality of education of students, not only for students in Caloocan city but to all high school and universities, more specifically the benefits are:
- Students can evaluate, make a suggestion, complain to their teachers/professors anonymously.

- Teachers/Professors have a chance to improve their teachings.

**B. Immediate objectives**

We expect students to have more confidence as well as better time in school. Our objective is to have better schools and universities that have great and quality teachers. We want students to have their own opinion and be respectful. We also want teachers to be great, reflect and improve their styles through the feedback they receive or simply enjoy the feeling of having a high rating and positive comments, for them to feel how it's like to be liked by students.
- Students' learning will be enhanced.
- High-rated Teachers/Professor should be rewarded with a salary raise

- Potential new students can have a good idea what to be expected from the faculty

- Former teachers/professors can use their ratings to prove their credibility if they are looking for new teaching related jobs.
 If the project is successful, it should be extended to other schools and universities as well.

**III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT PLAN**

**A. Expected project results**

The faculty evaluation system should be able to execute an aspect-based sentiment analysis of students' feedback on their teachers, providing freedom to the students to express their opinions to their teachers without knowing which student posted that feedback and computed it statistically. The group expect that there will be a student who will abuse his/her freedom to post a comment that will come to the point of cursing and insulting his/her teacher, so the faculty evaluation system will be programmed to replace some harsh words with asterisk.
Overall, the project expects the system to result in better teaching through the feedback from the students, their comments and their ratings, in which the teachers will be able to see. As explained, the response of each student will be anonymous so the teacher will not see who commented what, but the feedback is visible. This way, teachers can reflect from the feedback and improve their style of teaching for better ratings next time. Schools can also see the performance of their teachers with a system like this based on the results. This will benefit both the students and teachers and will give an overall positive outcome to the schools that will use this system.

 This table shows the overall progression of the project proposal towards completion.

**C. Project Beneficiaries**

The beneficiaries of our project will be the schools, the students of the schools will be given an opportunity to give their opinions and to have feedbacks to their professors, either they want to give bad feedbacks or they want to applaud for that specific professor, it is up to them on what will be the feedbacks they want to give, this can help to make sure that the students have their own right to have their opinions expressed on certain professors or people anonymously, their identities are hidden to give them assurance that the professor they evaluated will not hold grudge on them, plus it can be a benefits for the professors too, they can read the feedbacks of their student to change and also improve their performance in order to meet the standards of their students, this can also help them to change their attitudes towards to their own students.

**D. Implementing agent management of project**

1. Our team will be responsible for all of the planning and managing the project operations, we will take the full responsibilities of the project implementation, we will be also responsible for reaching out to the associated organizations.
2. Our management will conduct a briefly checking of the progress everyday, our team will be in touch with each other in order to maintain cooperation, we are also conducting monitoring to each member of the team by help of Trello, it will help us to monitor on what are the task that has been already accomplished.

Our project operations are expected to continue to operate since our project is built for long term use, also the project will still be monitored by our team whenever the users encounter bugs and problems on our project, as for expansion, it will be up to our client whether they want to add features on the project that we are working, we are also up for any opinions from our users to help us improve the project.

**IV. PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION**

The group used Trello to monitor the project and keep the focus directed to the objectives.

**Trello Board (Project Development Phase)**

_Figure 1 Project Development_

Used to keep track of what needs to be done in the project, what's currently being worked on, and what's already finished. Trello Board is useful for monitoring what the team is currently working on. There is also an Activity Log which helps monitor what changes have been made towards the project and what time the changes have been made.

**V. BUDGET**

The budget used during the development of the project proposal is as follows:

**10.00 Project Personnel:**

00 The personnel involved in producing the project are the group of students in University of the East, hence this section costing 0 pesos as we did the proposal completely free without any third party cost except the equipment used.

**20.00 Subcontracts:**

00 There is no subcontract involved during the development of the project.

**30.00 Training:**

00 There is no training involved in the team while developing the project. The only considerable practice that the team got is that they all study in University of the East. If we take that into consideration, the tuition fee this semester costs about ₱60,000 which is paid by every member in the team individually.

**40.00 Equipment:**

00 Desktop: Members uses their own desktop during the development which costs range from ₱20,000 to ₱60,000
42.00 Laptop: Members uses their own laptop during the development which costs range from ₱20,000 to ₱60,000

**50.00 Miscellaneous:**

00 Electricity: The team needs to pay for electricity during the development process which does not exceed ₱1000 during the days that the development is active.
00 Database: The team needs to pay for the database during the development process which costs range from ₱5,ooo to ₱20,000.
00 Internet: The team needs to pay for internet during the development process which does not exceed ₱2,500 during the days that the development is active.

**VI. FRAMEWORK OF SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND ARCHITECTURE**

_Figure 2 Login Process ERD_

This shows the tables and the login process used by the system. The data of the login table will be used to store all the data in which users will use to login their accounts. The student and faculty table will provide the details of the students and teachers on their profile, this includes school details and personal information such as name and address.
